Constellation is an open-source, serverless, end-to-end framework that simplifies the challenges of geographically distributed API load testing. It can simulate loads of up to 10,000 concurrent users from all across the globe, and tests can be of any duration, from minutes to hours or longer. Users can also see the results of their load test in an easy-to-read locally installed visualizer app.
